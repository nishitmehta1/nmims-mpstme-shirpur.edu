<p>Over the years, NMIMS has grown into an outstanding academic establishment in India covering varied areas of academic interests, and attracting an equally diverse faculty and student body.</p>
<p>The year 1981 saw the opening up of the Management Education System in Mumbai with the decision of the University of Mumbai to allow new management Institutes to be set up. The pressing demand for management education, coupled with a keen sense of social commitment on the part of SVKM led to the birth of Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies named after the intrepid entrepreneur the Late Shri. Narsee Monjee. Over the years it has evolved as a citadel of management thought and learning.</p>
