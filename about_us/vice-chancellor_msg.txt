<p>SVKM’s NMIMS Deemed to be University (as per UGC Norms) , declared as Deemed University under section 3 of the UGC Act 1956 in 2003, emerged from the erstwhile India’s Top Ten Business School – Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS). As a Business School, it was set up in 1981 and by 1993 emerged as one of the Top Ten Business Schools in India. Our parent body, Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal has an excellent track record of contributing to the cause of education for the last 75 years. On accreditation in 1999, an opportunity of becoming a University was available to NMIMS. Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal, whose footprints were already there in primary, secondary and higher education in Management, Technology, Commerce and Economics, Arts and Science decided to seek the opportunity. Based on the performance and the commitment of the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies was declared Deemed University in 2003 under section 3 of the UGC Act 1956.</p>
<p>The University was first accredited by NAAC in 1999 with a 5 star rating and subsequently reaccredited with grade A by NAAC in 2006. The Government of India conferred on the University permanent recognition in 2008.</p>
<p>The University’s primary goal is to provide good quality education in the country. It aims to develop employable youth. Pursuing these goals, the University took the initiative in the areas of Technology Management and Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharma Tech. Management, Architecture and Sciences besides strengthening its foothold in Management education through innovative programmes. It also set up an Undergraduate School for delivering innovative and path breaking BBA and B.Com.(Hons.) Programmes. To serve the needs of the working executives who cannot attend regular programmes, the University also has continuing executive education programmes.</p>
<p>We live today in an interdependent world. Hence it becomes imperative for us at the University to also pursue an internationalization agenda. Internationalization to us means creating an international environment in our programmes and campus. This we seek to achieve through our academic partnership with major U.S. and Australian Universities and European business schools. International faculty on the campus and international students help us in creating the international environment. Encouraging our students to participate in international events also helps in achieving our goal. Over the next couple of years, we will be pursuing the agenda of bringing students from overseas markets in our regular programmes. Besides, we aim to have a good mix of international and national faculty.</p>
<p>Our belief is that the faculty plays a significant role in influencing careers and in some cases the destiny of the students of the University. Hence development of faculty who will play this role is of utmost importance to us. It is towards this end that we have an understanding with leading institutions like Harvard Business School for development of our faculty.</p>
<p>The University aims to create a learner centric environment. We hope to create a learning experience for all our participants, an experience that will impact their careers and their lives.</p>
<p>I welcome you to our University.
