<p>NMIMS commenced its journey 32 years ago as a Management Institute recognized by the Mumbai University. On the basis of SVKM&apos;s invaluable contribution to the field of education, particularly in management learning, the institute was accorded the Deemed University status in 2003 by the Government of India, as per UGC recommendations.</p>
<p>Since then, the University has grown phenomenally, venturing into areas as diverse as technology, pharmacy, architecture, analytical science, commerce, and business education. It has broken new ground by offering the five year integrated MBA Tech. program, a unique combination of engineering and management; likewise, MBA Pharma Tech, an amalgam of Pharma Technology and Management, has also been introduced.</p>
<p>Our goal at the University is to design and deliver programs that cater to market requirements. We believe that given the socioeconomic dynamics of our nation, NMIMS has a special role to play in enhancing the employability of young Indians and helping the economy acquire a competitive edge. To this end, the various schools of the University have constantly been updating the programs and the pedagogy, while the faculty has actively been engaging in academic research. We are committed to making NMIMS a Centre for outstanding learning experience.</p>
<p>The University plans to set up campuses across India to address the need for quality education, thereby creating a pool of topnotch professionals.</p>
<p>I welcome you to discover our University.
